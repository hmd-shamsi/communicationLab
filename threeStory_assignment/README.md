concept:

I had so much fun coming up with the idea for this assignment (attached). It involves two concepts: the sphinx's riddle regarding human progression and a blockbuster Brad Pitt movie, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." Reading the panel from left to right displays what seems to be a normal person growing up, from a lost infant roaming around beautiful flowers, a teen happily graduating, to an old man walking by his supposed graveyard. Particular messages in each panel represent the answer to the riddle: "What being has four legs, then two, and then three?" However, when reading the panels from right to left, an entirely different message is revealed, referring to the earlier movie of a person born old but dying as a child. I hope you enjoy this piece as much as I did making it!
