## ***concept***

This week's assignment required us to make an interactive comic that includes all previouse learned concepts of HTML, JS, and CSS. I intended to have a minimalistic yet highly creative appraoch and story that would grasp the user's attention throughout the story, whilst also including them with a twist!

## ***method***

Given the three main concepts, HTML being responsible for the layout, CSS for the design, and JS for the functionality, it was essential to distribute the work equally. That being said, different concepts were implemented separately to enhance that specific portion further. The layout in mind consisted of 7 other panels with multiple art styles, all representing an extra dimension that the main character, the Professor, goes through. The user can then press a button representing a machine built by the professor to make the machine work. Additionally, background and traveling animation would present a form of excitement and entertainment throughout the interactive comic. Finally, all panels and buttons were custom drawn and illlustrated to better represent its corresponding art-style.
