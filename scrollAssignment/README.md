This week's assignment required us to implement the notion of parallax scrolling in a website containing beneficial information. This process includes adding any aspect of animation as the user goes through the website. This feature adds a playful and attractive element to one's website, further providing higher chances for the user to stay. I was excited to delve into this assignment, given that it is a JavaScript-based process. My idea was to present an aesthetic website showing a city and its corresponding information and the numerous travel sites one could go to. The user can somehow go through the building of the present city as they scroll through the website, presenting a 'belonging' message that further attracts them. This website could act as a tourist-guidance website, an aesthetically attractive one.

It was essential to find a way to take advantage of how beneficial the functionality of JavaScript is, especially the layering system present. So, starting, I chose the city of 'Dubai' and got an image that I found best to work with my idea. Then, I used an online-editing website to separate the image into seven different layers. This was done by utilizing the lasso tool and geometric lasso tool. I ended up classifying each image layer and assigning it to different z-axis. Minor adjustments were added to make the website look prettier such as a fade at the end and text highlights.

Embedding links to reserve spots for activities/hotels would be beneficial. Also, having a tab with a link to all cities of the UAE would be convenient.
