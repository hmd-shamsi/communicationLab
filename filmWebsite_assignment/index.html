  <h5 id="desc">
    <span class="highlight"> HAMAD MILKSHAKE </span> is a fresh business
    launched in Abu Dhabi aiming to fulfill your sweet appetite! Creative
    enthusiast and chef Hamad AlShamsi found inspiration for the cafe when he
    accidentally dropped and oreo cookie into a 'secret ingredient' instead of
    the anticipated milk. The combination was so stunning that he decided to
    initiate an entire project based on it. The contemporary-lively menu
    consists of appetizing bites to yummy drinks that are guaranteed to make you
    fall in love with our offered selections!
