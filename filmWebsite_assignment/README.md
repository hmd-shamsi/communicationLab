## ***concept:***

This week's assignment required making a website based on our 30MFF video, Hamad Milkshake. Thus, my idea is to create an advertising website for such a tasty product. This will also include a menu the user can go through and possibly click on to order directly! Also, having a menu (slim) format would be aesthetically pleasing to one's eye.

## ***method:***

One of my priorities was to have all of the information on the website. To begin with, this required utilizing HTML. This required making up the menu items, images, categories, etc... Then, it was essential to make it look like an actual menu; this is when CSS comes in. Using a color palette was ideal for making it look easy on one's eye and adding margins, paddings, and borders to separate the present content. In the end, adding links to the actual store where the "Hamad Milkshake" originates from was the icing on the cake... or milkshake, that is.

## ***future improvements:***

Explore JavaScript further and implement it to my liking, making the website reactive to scrolling.
